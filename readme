# GETH wrapper to enable erc7562Tracer

1. build go-ethereum in its homw with `docker build -t erc7562-geth
	(todo: merge it into this script's build)
2. in this project, do `docker build -t geth-erc7562-proxy`
	this will reference the above erc7562-geth

to run:

`docker run --rm -ti -e REMOTE_NODE={nodeurl} -p 8545:8545 -p 8546:8546 geth-erc7562-proxy`

- docker image starts, and query REMOTE_NODE for its chainId
- brings locally a debug geth (with our tracer)
- all rpc commands are forward as-is to REMOTE_NODE
- when receiving `debug_traceCall` with `tracer:erc7562Tracer`, it does:
  - perform `prestateTracer` call on remote node
  - execute erc7562Tracer locally, with the collected prestate
- effectively, the outcome is as if the remote node supports erc7562Tracer

NOTE:
- unfortunately, debug_traceTransaction is harder to handle, since we can't serve the remote block
- a utility script trace "trace-transaction" makes s "traceCall" on the previous block. this is "almost" as doing traceTransaction
