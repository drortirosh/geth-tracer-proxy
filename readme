# GETH wrapper to enable erc7562Tracer

A wrapper for geth.
forward all request to remote host
Special handling for debug_traceCall with tracer=erc7562Tracer
- run "prestateTracer" on remote host
- run erc7562 on local geth 
- return output as if remote node processed the trace.

to build docker, run `./build.sh`
it will create "geth-erc7562-proxy" image.

run locally with `./run {rpcurl}`


### testing:

run `./test.sh`

- it grabs an old sepolia tx
- runs against latest block (fails non "nonce error")
- runs against a block before, and it succeeds

with `native_tracer="*"`, can run any tracer with local geth (e.g. callTracer), and compare the outputs, and they are the same
