# GETH wrapper to enable erc7562Tracer

A wrapper for geth.
forward all request to remote host
Special handling for debug_traceCall with tracer=erc7562Tracer
- run "prestateTracer" on remote host
- run erc7562 on local geth 
- return output as if remote node processed the trace.

to build docker, run `./build.sh`
it will create "geth-erc7562-proxy" image.

run locally with `./run {rpcurl}`


### testing:

run `./run.sh "https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_KEY}"` in a separate window.
(first time rebuild the docker)

run `./test.sh` to run a test transaction
- picks up an old tx on sepolia

- attempt to run against "latest". fails on nonce error (which is expected)
- repeat against a PREVIOUS block. should succeed...
